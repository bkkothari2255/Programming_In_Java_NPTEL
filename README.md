## [WEEK 3](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/tree/WEEK-3)

  [Java Week 3:Q1](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-3/Fibonacci.java) To the generation of Fibonacci numbers.

  [Java Week 3:Q2](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-3/Circle.java) Define a class Point with two fields x and y each of type double. Also , define a method distance(Point p1, Point p2) to calculate the distance between points p1 and p2 and return the value in double. Complete the code segment given below. Use Math.sqrt( ) to calculate the square root.

  [Java Week 3:Q3](https://github.com/bkkothari2255/Programming_In_Java_NPTEL/blob/WEEK-3/Test1.java) A class Shape is defined with two overloading constructors in it. Another class Test1 is partially defined which inherits the class Shape. The class Test1 should include two overloading constructors as appropriate for some object instantiation shown in main( ) method. You should define the constructors using the super class constructors. Also, override the method calculate( ) in Test1 to calculate the volume of a Shape.
